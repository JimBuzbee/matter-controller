# Web-Based Matter Controller Examples

This repository contains examples of Matter Controllers that utilize a web socket to communicate with the [Matter Shell](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/tree/main/packages/nodejs-shell) from the [matter.js](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js) project. All the functionality of the standard matter shell is available, including commissioning devices, controlling devices,  querying device status and capabilities, accepting asynchronous device changes, etc.  The basic strategy is to send standard matter shell commands over a websocket to the matter.js shell, and then capture the results to create or update the user interface in a browser. For details of the matter.js shell capabilities, see the  [Matter Shell project](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js/tree/main/packages/nodejs-shell)
